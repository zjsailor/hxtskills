# Genetic Literature Review Workflow

## Phased Writing Process with PDF Integration

### Phase 1: Topic Definition and PDF Preparation
**Objective**: Define the genetic topic and prepare provided PDFs for integration

**Tasks**:
1. Identify the specific genetic topic (e.g., gene therapy for rare diseases, population genetics of inherited disorders)
2. Define scope parameters (technologies covered, disorders included, time frame)
3. Establish clinical and scientific relevance
4. Set target audience (researchers, clinicians, interdisciplinary)
5. Determine reference limit (30-80) and word count (4000-8000)
6. Collect and organize provided PDFs for NotebookLM processing
7. Identify key stakeholders and intended applications

**Deliverables**:
- Defined topic statement
- Scope boundaries document
- Target audience profile
- Reference and word count goals
- Organized PDF collection

### Phase 2: Literature Search Strategy Development
**Objective**: Create a comprehensive and reproducible search strategy

**Tasks**:
1. Identify appropriate databases (PubMed, GeneCards, OMIM, dbGaP, ClinVar)
2. Develop search terms around: gene, genetic, rare disease, sequencing, inherited disorder
3. Create Boolean search strings with MeSH terms
4. Plan date restrictions and language filters
5. Design inclusion/exclusion criteria
6. Plan gray literature search if appropriate

**Deliverables**:
- Search strategy document
- Database-specific queries
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Search timeline

### Phase 3: PDF Processing with NotebookLM
**Objective**: Extract relevant information from provided PDFs

**Tasks**:
1. Upload provided PDFs to Google NotebookLM
2. Extract key references and citations from PDFs
3. Identify important data points and statistics
4. Summarize key findings from PDFs
5. Integrate PDF references into overall reference pool
6. Create REFERENCES_PDF.md with extracted citations
7. Generate DATA_SUMMARY.md with key data points

**Deliverables**:
- REFERENCES_PDF.md with extracted references
- DATA_SUMMARY.md with key data points
- Integration plan for PDF references

### Phase 4: Systematic Literature Identification
**Objective**: Identify and screen all relevant literature systematically

**Tasks**:
1. Execute searches across all planned databases
2. Remove duplicates from combined results
3. Screen titles for relevance to genetic topic
4. Assess abstracts against inclusion criteria
5. Retrieve full texts for eligible articles
6. Perform quality assessment of included studies
7. Document reasons for exclusions
8. Merge database results with PDF references

**Deliverables**:
- PRISMA flow diagram
- Combined studies list (database + PDF sources)
- Excluded studies with reasons
- Quality assessment scores

### Phase 5: Data Extraction and Synthesis Planning
**Objective**: Extract relevant information and plan synthesis approach

**Tasks**:
1. Extract study characteristics (design, population, methods)
2. Record genetic findings and statistical measures (OR, P-values, effect sizes)
3. Identify genetic technologies and methodologies used
4. Catalog clinical implications and outcomes
5. Plan thematic organization for synthesis
6. Create data matrices for comparison tables
7. Identify gaps and inconsistencies in literature
8. Incorporate data from provided PDFs into matrices

**Deliverables**:
- Data extraction spreadsheets
- Comparison matrices with PDF data integrated
- Thematic organization plan
- Gap analysis summary

### Phase 6: Outline Development and Structure Creation
**Objective**: Create comprehensive outline for the review manuscript

**Tasks**:
1. Organize content thematically (by technology, disorder, or methodology)
2. Create hierarchical outline with major and minor sections
3. Plan integration of tables and figures
4. Allocate word counts to each section
5. Design Key Points box content
6. Plan transitions between sections
7. Ensure balanced coverage across topics
8. Plan placement of 1-2 key data summary tables
9. Plan 2-3 figures with detailed captions

**Deliverables**:
- Detailed manuscript outline
- Section-by-section word allocation
- Table and figure plans
- Key Points content draft

### Phase 7: Sequential Manuscript Composition
**Objective**: Write manuscript following phased approach

**Tasks**:
1. **Step 1**: Write Title and Keypoints
2. **Step 2**: Write Abstract
3. **Step 3**: Write Introduction
4. **Step 4**: Write Methods section
5. **Step 5**: Write Results section with:
   - Table 1: Key data summary
   - Table 2: Secondary data summary
   - Figure 1: Main data visualization
   - Figure 2: Secondary data visualization
6. **Step 6**: Write remaining content sections
7. **Step 7**: Write Discussion
8. **Step 8**: Write Conclusion
9. **Step 9**: Compile Figures and Tables section
10. **Step 10**: Create comprehensive References section

**Deliverables**:
- Complete manuscript draft in phases
- Integrated tables with data from PDFs
- Figure descriptions with detailed captions
- Reference list (30-80 sources from both databases and PDFs)

### Phase 8: Quality Assurance and Finalization
**Objective**: Ensure manuscript meets quality standards and completion criteria

**Tasks**:
1. Verify all claims have adequate citation support
2. Check adherence to genetic nomenclature standards
3. Validate statistical reporting accuracy
4. Review for objective tone and hedging language
5. Confirm reference count is within 30-80 range
6. Verify word count is within 4000-8000 range
7. Finalize Key Points box with 3-5 bullets
8. Proofread for grammar and style consistency
9. Ensure all PDF-derived data is properly cited

**Deliverables**:
- Final manuscript ready for review
- Compliance verification checklist
- Quality assurance report
- Submission-ready document

## Quality Control Points
