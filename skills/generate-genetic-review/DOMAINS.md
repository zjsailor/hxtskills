## Literature Organization Framework

When conducting a genetic literature review, consider organizing by:
1. Primary domain (most relevant to research question)
2. Technology platform (if technology-focused review)
3. Clinical application (if application-focused review)
4. Population studied (if population-specific review)
5. Temporal progression (chronological development of field)

This framework allows for flexible organization while maintaining scientific rigor and comprehensive coverage.
