# Implementation Plan for Genetic Literature Review

## Phase 1: Project Initialization and PDF Preparation
- [ ] Define specific genetic topic and scope
- [ ] Set reference limit (30-80 references)
- [ ] Establish word count target (4000-8000 words)
- [ ] Create project directory structure
- [ ] Initialize manuscript draft file
- [ ] Create REFERENCES_PDF.md for PDF references
- [ ] Create DATA_SUMMARY.md for key data points
- [ ] Collect and organize provided PDFs
- [ ] Identify primary search terms related to:
  - [ ] gene/genetic
  - [ ] rare disease
  - [ ] sequencing
  - [ ] inherited disorder
  - [ ] population genetics
  - [ ] genomic medicine

## Phase 2: Literature Search Strategy
- [ ] Design PubMed search query with MeSH terms
- [ ] Include terms: "genetic*", "gene", "rare disease", "sequencing", "inherited disorder"
- [ ] Apply date filters (typically last 10 years)
- [ ] Set inclusion criteria for article types
- [ ] Plan secondary searches in specialized databases
- [ ] Document search strategy for reproducibility

## Phase 3: PDF Processing with Google NotebookLM
- [ ] Prepare collected PDFs for NotebookLM upload
- [ ] Upload PDFs to Google NotebookLM
- [ ] Extract key references from PDFs
- [ ] Identify important data points and statistics
- [ ] Summarize key findings from PDFs
- [ ] Add PDF references to REFERENCES_PDF.md
- [ ] Extract data points to DATA_SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Plan integration of PDF content into manuscript

## Phase 4: Source Identification and Screening
- [ ] Execute primary literature search
- [ ] Export results to reference manager
- [ ] Screen titles for relevance
- [ ] Assess abstracts against inclusion criteria
- [ ] Resolve conflicts in selection
- [ ] Document excluded articles and reasons
- [ ] Merge database results with PDF references

## Phase 5: Data Extraction and Organization
- [ ] Extract key information from selected articles
- [ ] Organize by genetic technology, disorder type, or methodology
- [ ] Record statistical measures and effect sizes
- [ ] Note study design and sample characteristics
- [ ] Identify key findings and limitations
- [ ] Create reference database
- [ ] Integrate data from DATA_SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Organize data for table creation

## Phase 6: Draft Outline Creation
- [ ] Develop hierarchical outline based on themes
- [ ] Plan section organization (technology-focused, disorder-focused, etc.)
- [ ] Allocate approximate word counts per section
- [ ] Design Table 1: Key data summary
- [ ] Design Table 2: Secondary data summary
- [ ] Plan Figure 1: Main data visualization
- [ ] Plan Figure 2: Secondary data visualization
- [ ] Identify areas requiring synthesis
- [ ] Ensure balanced coverage across topics

## Phase 7: Sequential Manuscript Composition
### Step 1: Title and Keypoints
- [ ] Write informative title
- [ ] Create 3-5 key points summary

### Step 2: Abstract
- [ ] Write structured abstract (background, methods, results, conclusions)

### Step 3: Introduction
- [ ] Establish genetic background
- [ ] Define clinical significance
- [ ] Outline scope and contributions

### Step 4: Methods
- [ ] Detail literature search strategy
- [ ] Specify inclusion/exclusion criteria
- [ ] Describe data extraction process
- [ ] Document quality assessment procedures

### Step 5: Results
- [ ] Present main findings
- [ ] Create Table 1: Key data summary with data from PDFs
- [ ] Create Table 2: Secondary data summary with data from PDFs
- [ ] Create Figure 1: Main data visualization description
- [ ] Create Figure 2: Secondary data visualization description

### Step 6: Content Sections
- [ ] Write remaining content sections
- [ ] Integrate findings from provided PDFs
- [ ] Ensure proper citation of PDF sources

### Step 7: Discussion
- [ ] Interpret findings in clinical context
- [ ] Address limitations
- [ ] Propose future directions

### Step 8: Conclusion
- [ ] Summarize key findings
- [ ] Highlight clinical implications

### Step 9: Figures and Tables
- [ ] Provide detailed descriptions of all visual elements
- [ ] Include data sources and statistical information

### Step 10: References
- [ ] Compile all sources in proper format
- [ ] Include references from both databases and PDFs
- [ ] Ensure all citations are properly formatted

## Phase 8: Quality Assurance and Completion
- [ ] Verify all claims have citation support
- [ ] Check adherence to genetic nomenclature standards
- [ ] Ensure statistical reporting is accurate and consistent
- [ ] Confirm Key Points box is informative
- [ ] Review for hedging language and objective tone
- [ ] Validate reference count (30-80 range)
- [ ] Verify all PDF-derived data is properly cited
- [ ] Final proofread and formatting check

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Manuscript addresses genetic topic comprehensively
- [ ] Reference count falls within 30-80 range
- [ ] Word count falls within 4000-8000 range
- [ ] Contains 1-2 well-designed data summary tables
- [ ] Includes 2-3 figures with detailed captions
- [ ] Successfully integrates provided PDF references
- [ ] All PDF-derived content is properly cited
- [ ] Each major section has limitations paragraph
- [ ] Clinical implications are clearly discussed
- [ ] Future directions are proposed
- [ ] Writing follows established guidelines
- [ ] Manuscript follows phased writing approach
